This project develops an AI-powered system for recommending academic articles based on users' interests and reading history. Using Python Django, Firebase and NLP techniques (FastText, SciBERT), articles and user profiles are vectorized and similarity is calculated with Cosine Similarity. The user logs into the system by specifying their interests during registration and receives dynamically updated recommendations. The recommendation system is continuously improved by collecting user feedback. Article recommendations are personalized by storing users' reading history on Firebase. Finally, the system performance is evaluated with Precision and Recall metrics and presented to the user.
